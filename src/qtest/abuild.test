# Test 9 exercises traits.

# We have three traits: eater, painter, and edible.  A depends upon
# A-dep, is eaten by AB-eater, and is painted by A-painter.
# Additionally, A-dep is painted by A-dep-painter.  B is also eaten by
# AB-eater and by B-eater.  A-eater-painter both paints and eats A.
# Painters and eaters depend upon the things they paint or eat.  A and
# B are both edible by AB-eater even though the dependency is in the
# reverse direction.  The directory structure is set up so that A is
# under its own directory and everything else is together.  This makes
# it easy to construct build sets that initially contain only A.  We
# illustrate several things:
#
#  * When we create a build set starting with A and expand it with the
#    eater trait, this pulls in AB-eater which in turn depends upon B.
#    This subsequently pulls in B-eater.
#
#  * A and B are related to other build items that depend upon them
#    and that they therefore do not depend upon.  This exercises the
#    lack of connection between the dependency graph and trait
#    relationships.
#
#  * We use the various traits both as only-with traits and as
#    related-by traits.
#
#  * If we create a build set using the painter trait and expand it
#    using the eater trait, we get A as a dependency of A-painter and
#    AB-eater as an eater of A.  If we create a build set using the
#    eater trait and expand it using the painter trait, we also get
#    B-eater.
#
#  * If we build a set using both the eater and the painter traits, we
#    get only the item that is both along with its dependencies.
#
#  * Trait-based clean sets do not follow dependencies.
#
# Everything depends upon additional build items that define other
# targets so we can always tell the difference between the default
# target and the explicit target.

# Test 10 exercises shared libraries.  Although shared library
# functionality is exercised in the examples and in other parts of the
# test suite, test10 goes through several scenarios that cover some of
# the corner cases and potential pitfalls of using shared libraries.
# The idea of these test cases is to make sure that doing proper
# dependency-aware builds successfully mitigates most of the problems.

# The following build items are used in these test cases:

# static: a library with a method called printString whose value comes
# from a file at compile time.

# shared1: a shared library that depends on static and has the option
# of being built either with or without linking against the static
# library.  After build, it resets LIBS and adds itself so that
# depending on shared1 doesn't put static into the library list.

# prog1: depends on shared1 but not on static; can only link if static
# is linked into shared1.

# shared1-alt: identical interface to shared1 enabling it to replace
# shared1 at runtime; depends on static and links with its library.
# Also uses an after-build file to remove static from the library
# list.

# shared2: different interface; also depends privately on static, and
# also has the option of being build without linking the static
# library.

# prog2: like prog1 but links with shared2

# prog3: links with shared1 and shared2; enables us to exercise
# conditions in which shared1 and shared2 where both linked with
# static

# prog4: links with shared1 and static, calls printString itself;
# enables us to exercise conditions in which prog4 and shared1 both
# have static

# In addition to the above, we also exercise handling of orphan
# targets in ccxx here.
