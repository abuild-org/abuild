Run "abuild --help rules rule:rulename" for help on a specific rule.
Run "abuild --help rules toolchain:rulename" for help on a specific toolchain.

When an rule is shown to be available, it means that it is provided by
a build item that is in your dependency chain or is a plugin that is
active for your build item.  When a toolchain is shown to be
available, it means it is provided by a plugin that is active for your
build item.  Built-in toolchains and rules are always available.  In
order to make use of a rule or toolchain, it must also work for your
platform and be available for your item's target type.
