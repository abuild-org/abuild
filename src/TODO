1.0.b4 or 1.0
=============

 * Make sure the README and Artistic files are handled sensibly at
   release time.

 * Look at all XXX comments.


Documentation
-------------

 * ccosta comments

    - introduce "continue on error" earlier

    - revisit use of no-op earlier in the document

    - expand "Integration with QTest" to discuss qtest in one
      paragraph and include a reference to the qtest documentation and
      software

    - recheck XXX

 * Make sure documentation for integration with third party packages
   is sufficient.

 * Consider adding a trouble shooting section

    - example: library name inconsistency between Abuild.mk and
      Abuild.interface


Abuild Contrib
--------------

 * Include pieces of the abuild library including at least doxygen and
   javadoc plugins.  Mention this in the installation part of the
   documentation.


Bugs
====

 * There are some Windows path issues.  Find out the real story behind
   Windows paths.  See whether using absolute paths is better than
   relative paths for Windows.  If so, this has implications as there
   is a mixture of Windows native and cygwin tools in use.

 * Wade Taylor reports: I just noticed a quirk in
   Abuild-ant.properties: whitespace is not "trimmed" after an
   abuild.hook-build-item.

 * Spencer Allain reports: I'm not quite sure what is going on, but
   doing a Ctrl-C on abuild under Windows results in my console
   session being totally hosed permanently.

 * Ant seems to not complain when populating an ear file from a
   classpath that contains non-existent items.  In general, there may
   be an issue with not getting any notification of non-existent
   classpath items.

 * Orphan target detection won't find orphan targets in
   subdirectories.  This is very hard to fix in general.  We could
   search directories represented in the source lists, but that
   wouldn't help if we removed the last file from a subdirectory.  For
   now, we'll just not handle this case.

 * Cass Dalton reports that he sometimes gets "resource busy" errors
   when running autoconf with --make-jobs.


Java Problems
=============

We probably need a different approach to Java.  Ant was not designed
to be used as a framework, and it doesn't work very well when used in
this way.

 * We should add the Main-Class attribute to the manifest of a jar
   when the abuild.main-class property is set:

     <attribute name="Main-Class" value="${abuild.main-class}"/>

   How do we do this conditionally upon the existence of that
   property?  There is a comment in abuild.xml and also various
   remarks in the documentation.  Search for "manifest".

 * In order to get wars in ear files, we need to add them to
   abuild.classpath.  Although this is harmless, it's sort of an abuse
   of abuild.classpath.

 * We don't detect when inaccessible build items are referenced in
   abuild.hook-build-items

 * Abuild has no real way to support a difference between compile-time
   classpaths and run-time classpaths.

 * NOTE: It was necessary to create /usr/{share,lib}/java-1.6.0 in
   order for build-classpath from jpackage to do the right thing when
   launching ant 1.7.0 in fedora core 5.  Not sure how general of a
   problem this is.

 * Reconsider using depends task for compile in abuild.xml.

 * Signed jar support will eventually be required.

 * Our default java compile rule doesn't notice if a .java file was
   removed.  Maybe we want to force full recompilation if the list of
   files changed, or maybe we want to delete class files that appear
   to have come from non-existent java files.  I'm not sure what
   happens with nested/inner classes that disappeared....does javac
   automatically remove the corresponding class files?  This would be
   an easy experiment to try.

 * Consider supporting creation of multiple jar files with different
   contents analogous to different libraries being created from a
   single C++ build item.


Other
=====

See also "Known Limitations" in the documentation.

 * gen_deps: rewrite so that it doesn't force a runtime dependency on
   perl.  It should be a fallback for cases when compilers can't
   generate dependency information.  With gcc, use -MD -MF -MP to
   generate proper .dep files.  xlc: "-M -MF a.dep" works, but there
   is no equivalent to -MP, so we'll need to postprocess.  VC:
   nothing.

 * Test qtest coverage from abuild test suite

 * Think about implementing a dependency analyzer that would look at
   first-level includes to figure out what the correct list of direct
   dependencies should be.

 * Consider having --silent invoke make with --no-print-directory.  If
   we do this, we should follow build item failure with a message that
   contains the name, path, and platform of whatever failed.

 * Consider having an abuild template generator that can run if no
   Abuild.conf or other files are present.  This would spit out
   commented template files.  Alternatively, could be a command-line
   wizard or something.

 * Need a way to get a list of build items that will be skipped
   because they have no platforms.  There are times when it would be
   nicer if it were an error to have no platforms available for an
   item in your local area rather than to just have it be skipped.

 * Consider testing junit in the test suite; for this to work, we need
   to figure out how abuild is going to know about junit.
   Alternatively, consider moving junit support to a plugin.

 * Piping ANSI color stuff through ant on Windows doesn't work.  When
   running qtest from ant on Windows, qtest correctly generates the
   ansi color codes, but they don't get displayed right through ant,
   at least in cygwin.

 * To check for all Abuild.mk files that define local targets:
   pcregrep '^\s*\S+\s*:(\Z|[^=])' **/Abuild.mk

 * Consider having an option for abuild to look upward until it finds
   an Abuild.conf.  This must not be the default behavior.

 * It might be useful to have the ability to find all references to a
   particular interface variable and/or to find the origin and
   variable history for a specific variable.  This comes back to the
   interface tracing mode or dump mode.  Examples: I see some
   interface variable in a build item's Abuild.interface file and want
   to know who uses it, or I see some variable in someone's
   Abuild-ant.properties or Abuild.mk and want to know who defines it.

 * Use re-entrant scanners instead of C++ scanners.  This requires
   flex >= 2.5.33.  Have abuild's own build process detect whether or
   not a new enough version of flex is available.  If so, it should
   generate the parsers and attempt to update a cached copy of the
   automatically generated files if they have changed.  Otherwise, it
   should use the cached files by adding them to SRCS in place of the
   automatically generated ones.  We also need to disable warnings for
   the flex-generated code.  Use %option nounistd.

 * Test, at least informally, backing areas on different drive letters
   on Windows.  Not sure whether it's worth putting this in the test
   suite.

 * It would be nice if there were a mechanism for providing
   documentation on traits so that --list-traits could tell the user
   how each trait was intended to be used.

 * Consider capturing the output of the backend so that we can
   de-interleave output when running parallel builds, separate error
   from informational output, etc.

 * Clean up ~/source/examples/java/native/abuild and use as JNI
   example

 * Think about the idea of having some kind of extended plugin
   interface to allow additional policy validations to be made on a
   per-project basis.  Examples would be things like tier-based
   dependency rules, facade class interfaces not being violated, not
   having nested build items under directories that have items that
   build stuff, etc.  If this is done, update the documentation on
   custom access rules.

 * ccxx: Consider enforcing that no object file may appear both as a
   program and a library object file and that no object file may be
   generated from more than one source file (with different suffixes)

 * Consider converting abuild_data.dtd to a schema for tighter
   validation (which attributes are allowed in which contexts).
   Search for DTD in the documentation and test suite.

 * It would be nice if we could use higher resolution figures for the
   PDF than for the HTML.  There is plenty of material in the
   sagehill.net DocBook XSL guide about this.

 * We really need a way to be able to use autoconf to find out
   information about a specific compiler.  This would be especially
   useful for figuring out what flags to use for PIC when building
   shared libraries.
