Build items should set the abuild variable

  abuild.classpath

in their Abuild.interface files to the names of jar files
that are to be included in the classpaths of items that
depends upon them.  Build items that export other files may
declare and initialize their own variables to contain their
paths as long as those variables do not conflict with
variables exported by other build items.

Additionally, the variable

  abuild.classpath.external

can be set to the names of jarfiles that should be included
in the build classpath but should not be included in ear
files.
