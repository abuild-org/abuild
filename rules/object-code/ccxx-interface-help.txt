** Help for Abuild.interface for C/C++ build items **

Abuild.interface files for C/C++ build items are expected to assign to
the following variables:

  INCLUDES -- list of directories to add to the include path
  LIBDIRS -- list of directories to add to the library path
  LIBS -- list of libraries to link against

Note that LIBS just includes the library basenames as with the
TARGETS_lib variable used in Abuild.mk.

The following additional variables may also be assigned to:

  XCPPFLAGS
  XCFLAGS
  XCXXFLAGS
  XLINKFLAGS

Descriptions of these variables appear in the rules-help output.  When
using these variables, be careful to avoid code that is
compiler-dependent.  If necessary, make the assignments conditinal on
values of the ABUILD_PLATFORM_* variables.
